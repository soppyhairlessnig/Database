# Paris Arrow Transit (PAT) ‚Äì Olympic Transport Database System

This project was developed as part of the **FIT2094 ‚Äì Databases** unit at Monash University Malaysia. It simulates the backend system of a transportation company, **Paris Arrow Transit (PAT)**, subcontracted to transport Olympic officials during the Paris Games.

The system was built using **Oracle SQL** and **MongoDB** and demonstrates comprehensive database design, manipulation, and querying using both relational and non-relational approaches.
